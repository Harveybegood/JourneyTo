How does it weigh on you -> 这对你有什么影响吗？

Today, I watch CBS news, there is news anchor who has asked something to her guest, finally come to a question that how does it weigh on you. So what i have learnt from this sentence is the idiom of "weigh on". earlier than today, I probably use "affect" as a preferred 
option for expression of such meaning, alternatively, "any influence on you"...
