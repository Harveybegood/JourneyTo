- I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night and __the satisfication that__ the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye.  

- From East Egg, then, __came__ the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunson, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who  was drowned last summer up in Maine.  

- They will give you a better impression than my __generalities__ of those who accepted Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.  

- So my first impression, that he was a person of undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply __the proprietor of an elaborate road house__ next door.  

- His right hand suddenly __ordered divine retribution to stand by__.  

- And with this doubt, his whole statment fell to pieces, and I wondered if __there wasn't something a little sinister__ about him, after all.  

- The very phrase were __worn__ so __threadbare__ that they __evoked__ no image except that of a turbaned "character." leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.  

- I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to __bear an enchanted life__.  

- His __correctness__ grew on him.  

- __tipping__ his cap.  

- Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built __with a wish__ out of non-olfactory money.  

- The city __seen__ from the Queensboro Bridges is always the city __seen__ for the first time, in its __first wild promise__ of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.  

- In a __well-fanned__ Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. __Blinking__ away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes __picked him out obscurely__ in the anteroom, talking to another man.  

- A small, __flat-nosed__ Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which __luxuriated__ in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the __halfdarkness__.  

- Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, __whereupon__ Mr.Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a __somnamlabutory abstraction__.  

- __Filled__ with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever.  

- "It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd __of__ raised the blinds we'd of seen daylight" of == have. we would have raised  
- He's quite a character around New York - a __denizen__ of Broadway.  

- It never __occurred to me__ that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people--with the __single-mindedness__ of burglar __blowing a safe__.  

- They shook hands briefly, and a __strained__, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby's face. 

- "How've you been, anyhow?" __demanded Tom of me__. "How'd you happen to come up this far to eat?"  

- We gave her __spirits of ammonia__ and put ice on her forehead and __hooked her back into__ her dress.  

- Next day at five o'clock she married Tom Buchanan without __so much as__ a shiver, and __started off__ on a three months' trip to the South seas.  

- I thought I'd never seen a girl so __mad about(on)__ her husband.  

- You can hold your tongue, and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blink that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never __went in for__ amour at all - and yet there's something in that voice of hers...  

- wear the most __abstracted expression__ until she saw him coming back in the door.  

- It was the night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard __the elaborate way__ he __work up to__ it.  

- though he says he's read a Chicago paper for years just __on the change of__ catching a glimpse of Daisy's name.

- he's a regular tough __underneath it all__.  

- Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more, but of this clean, hard, and limited person, who __dealt in universal scepticism__,  

- There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.  

- "And Daisy ought to have something in her life," murmured Jordan to me.  

- I had no girl whose __disembodied__ face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs,
