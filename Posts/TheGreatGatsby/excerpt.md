- I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night and __the satisfication that__ the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye.  

- From East Egg, then, __came__ the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunson, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who  was drowned last summer up in Maine.  

- They will give you a better impression than my __generalities__ of those who accepted Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.  

- So my first impression, that he was a person of undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply __the proprietor of an elaborate road house__ next door.  

- His right hand suddenly __ordered divine retribution to stand by__.  

- And with this doubt, his whole statment fell to pieces, and I wondered if __there wasn't something a little sinister__ about him, after all.  

- The very phrase were __worn__ so __threadbare__ that they __evoked__ no image except that of a turbaned "character." leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.

- His __correctness__ grew on him.  

- __tipping__ his cap.  

- Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built __with a wish__ out of non-olfactory money.  

- The city __seen__ from the Queensboro Bridges is always the city __seen__ for the first time, in its __first wild promise__ of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.
