- I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night and __the satisfication that__ the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye.  

- From East Egg, then, __came__ the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunson, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who  was drowned last summer up in Maine.  

- They will give you a better impression than my __generalities__ of those who accepted Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.  

- So my first impression, that he was a person of undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply __the proprietor of an elaborate road house__ next door.  

- His right hand suddenly __ordered divine retribution to stand by__.  

- And with this doubt, his whole statment fell to pieces, and I wondered if __there wasn't something a little sinister__ about him, after all.  

- The very phrase were __worn__ so __threadbare__ that they __evoked__ no image except that of a turbaned "character." leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.  

- I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to __bear an enchanted life__.  

- His __correctness__ grew on him.  

- __tipping__ his cap.  

- Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built __with a wish__ out of non-olfactory money.  

- The city __seen__ from the Queensboro Bridges is always the city __seen__ for the first time, in its __first wild promise__ of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.  

- In a __well-fanned__ Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. __Blinking__ away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes __picked him out obscurely__ in the anteroom, talking to another man.  

- A small, __flat-nosed__ Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which __luxuriated__ in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the __halfdarkness__.  

- Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, __whereupon__ Mr.Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a __somnamlabutory abstraction__.  

- But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realising in a vague way that that was all they came for.

- __Filled__ with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever.  

- "It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd __of__ raised the blinds we'd of seen daylight" of == have. we would have raised  
- He's quite a character around New York - a __denizen__ of Broadway.  

- It never __occurred to me__ that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people--with the __single-mindedness__ of burglar __blowing a safe__.  

- They shook hands briefly, and a __strained__, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby's face. 

- "How've you been, anyhow?" __demanded Tom of me__. "How'd you happen to come up this far to eat?"  

- We gave her __spirits of ammonia__ and put ice on her forehead and __hooked her back into__ her dress.  

- Next day at five o'clock she married Tom Buchanan without __so much as__ a shiver, and __started off__ on a three months' trip to the South seas.  

- I thought I'd never seen a girl so __mad about(on)__ her husband.  

- You can hold your tongue, and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blink that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never __went in for__ amour at all - and yet there's something in that voice of hers...  

- wear the most __abstracted expression__ until she saw him coming back in the door.  

- It was the night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard __the elaborate way__ he __work up to__ it.  

- though he says he's read a Chicago paper for years just __on the change of__ catching a glimpse of Daisy's name.

- he's a regular tough __underneath it all__.  

- Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more, but of this clean, hard, and limited person, who __dealt in universal scepticism__,  

- There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.  

- "And Daisy ought to have something in her life," murmured Jordan to me.  

- I had no girl whose __disembodied__ face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs,  

- At first I thought it was another party, a __wild rout__ that had __resolved itself into__ "hide-and-go-seek" or "sardines-in-the-box" with all the house thrown open to the game.  

- He __fumbled__ with a series of beginnings.  

- But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for __a service to be rendered__, I had no choice except to __cut him off__ there.  
- "I've got my __hands full__", I said. "I'm much obliged but I couldn't take on any more work."  

- Evidently he thought that I was __shying away from__ the "gonnegtion" mentioned at lunch, but  

- He waited a moment longer, hoping I'd being a conversation, but I was __too absorbed to be responsive__, so he went unwillingly home.  
- The evening had made me __light-headed__ and happy;  

- Gatsby, his hands still in his pocket, was reclining against the mantelpiece __in a strained counterfeit of__ perfect case, even of boredom.  

- His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his lips __parted__ with an __abortive attempt__ at a laugh.  

- I couldn't __muster up__ a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.  

- The __automatic quality__ of Gatsby's answer __set us all back__ at least another minute.  

- A brewer had built it early in the "period" craze,  

- Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to __Found a Family__  

- __Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.__  

- While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little now and then with __gusts of emotion__.  

- __short of__ pushing over the stove  

- through __period__ bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers,  

- He hadn't once __cease looking__ at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.  

- except where the dresser was garnished with a __toilet set of__ pure dull gold.  

- Whereupon Gatsby sat down and __shaded__ his eyes and began to laugh.  

- After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was __consumed with__ wonder at her presence.  

- He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, __waited with his teeth set__, so to speak, at an __inconceivable__ pitch of intensity.

- Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an __overwound__ clock.  

- He seemd absorbed in what he had just said.  

- Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her.  

- In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room, where there was no light __save__ what the gleaming floor bounced in the hall.  

- "One thing's sure and nothing's surer" The rich get richer and the poor get--children. In the meantime, In between time--"  

- as though a faint doubt had occurred to him __as to__ the quality of his present happiness.  

- He had __thrown himself into__ it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, __decking it out__ with every bright feather that drifted his way.  

- __No amount of__ fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.  

- I think that voice __held him most__, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn't be over-dreamed - that voice was a deathless song.  

- This was his off day and __with laudable initiative__ he had hurried out "to see".  

- It was __a random shot__.  

- Gatsby's notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities upon his past, had increased all summer until he __fell just short of__ being news.  

- Just why these inventions were a source of satisfication to James Gatz of North Dakota isn't easy to say.  

- He was a son of God--a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that-- and he must be about His Father's business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty.  

- His brown, hardening body lived natrually through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days.  

- He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they are ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which __in his overwhelming self-absorption__ he took for granted.  

- A universe __ineffable gaudiness__ spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon __soaked__ with wet light his tangled cloths upon the floor.  

- Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsies closed down upon some vivid scene __with an oblivious embrance__.  

- They were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that __the rock of the world__ was founded securely on a fairy's wing.  

- He stayed there two weeks, __dismayed at__ its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work __with which__ he was to pay his way through.  

- The transactions in Montana copper that made him __many times a__ millionaire found him physically rebust but __on the verge of soft-mindedness__,  

- The none too savoury remification __by which__ Elle Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid journalism of 1902.  

- He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he __turned up as__ James Gatz's destiny in Little Girl Bay.  
- __At any rate__ Cody asked him a few questions(one of them __elicited__ the brand new name) and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious. 

- He was employed in a vague __personal capacity__ - while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about, and he __provided for__ such contingencies by __reposing more and more trust__ in Gatsby.  

- He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague __contour__ of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the __substantialty__ of a man.  

- but I've __put it down__ here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his __antecedents__, which weren't even faintly ture.  

- the rest of us __exchanged a cool nod__.  

- Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness - it __stands out in my memory__ from Gatsby's other parties that summer.  

- __second to nothing__ because it had no consciousness of __being so__,  

- It is __invariably__ saddening to look through new eyes at __things upon which__ you have extended your own __powers of adjustment__. 

- Moreover He told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached __the point of believing everything and nothing__ about him.  

- "These things excite me so," she whispered.  

- Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely __human orchid of a woman__ who __sat in state__ under a white plum tree.  

- A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke __in Miss baedeker's defense__.  

- "__She's much obliged__, I'm sure," said another friend, without gratitude.  

- They were still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, __thin ray of moonlight__ between.  

- It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to __attain this proximity__, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one __ultimate degree__ and kiss at her cheek.  

- She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented "place" that Broadway had begotten upon a long island fish village - appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut __from nothing to nothing__.  

- Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.  

- He certainly must have __strained himself to__ get this manegerie together.

- "At least they're more interesting than the people we know," she said __with an effort__.  

- Her glance __left__ me and __sought__ the lighted top of the steps, where _Three O'clock in the morning_, a neat, sad little Waltz of that year, was __drifting out__ the open door.  

- After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby's party there were romantic possibilites totally __absent from her world__. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside?  

- Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, __one moment of magical encounter__, would __blot out__ those five years of __unwavering devotion__.  

- He wanted __nothing less of Daisy than__ that she should go to Tom and say: "I never loved you."  

- Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the __two changes of the year__.  

- Out of the corner of his eyes Gatsby saw that __the blocks of the sidewalks__ really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees - he could climb to it, if he climbed along, and once there he could suck on the __pap of life__, __gulp down the imcomparable milk of wonder__.  

- He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever __wed his unutterable visions to__ her __perishable breath__, his mind would never romp again like __the mind of God__.  

- For a moment a phrase tried to __take shape in my mouth__ and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though there was more struggling upon them than __a wisp of__ startled air.  

- It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night - and, __as obscurely as__ it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.  

- __Only gradually did__ I become aware that the automobiles turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away.  

- My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his housr a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village __to be bribed__ by the tradesmen, but ordered __moderate supplies__ over the telephone.  

- So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house __at the disapproval__ in her eyes.  

- He was calling up __at Daisy's request__ - would i come to lunch at her house tomorrow?  

- And yet I couldn't believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene - especially for the rather __harrowing scene__ that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.  

- holding it __at arm's length__ and __by the extreme tip of the corners__ to indicate that I had no designs upon it.  

- __That__ anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart!
