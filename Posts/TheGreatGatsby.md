<h2>Grasping Vs. Question</h2>
At the starting pages of this book, The narator who describes his experience. there is one thing that makes me confused.
He gratued from New Haven in 1915, then he went to the World War I, after that, he came back to his hometown - The Middle West, then 
his family inclucing his father and his uncles and aunts chose a prep school for him. well my question comes to that he finished his 
university in New Haven in 1915, why his family chose prep school for him? actually he finished his uni several years ago.
