The RBTree is difficult to grasp, especially, to its part of deletion which includes the minimum and maximum deletion and to delete any random one of nodes. 
RBTree is an extend to binary search tree which in an extreme condtion will generate a kind of tree as like linked list. Such as a set of number inserted in a sequence of 
increasing order, then its order of growth will increase from O(logN) to N. This is not a case of our expectation.  

RBTree has introduced some new properties to preserve approximate balanced search tree and which as follows:  
1. New node inserted is color red
2. There is no two consecutive nodes with color red in its left lean
3. There is no node with color red in its right lean
4. Root node must be black
5. The distance from random node to its leaves is same.  

To delete a node with minimum key, the idea that I cite it from Algorithm4.
> To ensure that we do not end up on a 2-node, we perform appropriate tranformations on the way down the tree to preserve the invariant that the current node is a 2-node
(it might be a 3-node or a temporary 4-node).

And below are the details to execute.  
First, to ensure root is not a 2-node. 
Then on the way down the tree, one of the following cases must hold:
1. if the left child of the current node is not a 2-node, there is nothing to do.
2. if the left child is a 2-node and its immediate sibling is not a 2-node, move a key from the sibling to the left child.
3. if the left child and its immediate sibling are 2-nodes, then combines them with the smallest key in the parent to make a 4-node, changing the parent from a 3-node to
a 2-node or from a 4-node to a 3-node.

```java
public void deleteMin(){
  if(isEmpty){throw new NoSuchElementException("BST underflow");}
  if(!isRed(node.left) && !isRed(node.right)){
    root.color = Red;
  }
  root = deleteMin(root);
  if(!isEmpty(){root.color = Black;}
}
private Node deleteMin(Node node){
  if(node.left == null){return null;}
  if(!isRed(node.left) && !isRed(node.left.left)){
    node = moveRedLeft(node);
  }
  node.left = deleteMin(node.left);
  return balace(node);
}
// auxiliary function, moveRedLeft
private Node moveRedLeft(node){
  flipColor(node);
  if(isRed(node.right.left)){
    node.right = rotateRight(node.right);
    node = rotateLeft(node);
    flipColor(node);
  }
  return node;
}
// auxiliary function balance
private Node balance(Node node){
  if (isRed(node.left) && isRed(node.left.left)) node = rotateRight(node);
    if (isRed(node.right) && isRed(node.right.right)) node = rotateLeft(node);
    if (isRed(node.left) && isRed(node.left.right)) node = rotateLeftRight(node);
    if (isRed(node.right) && isRed(node.right.left)) node = rotateRightLeft(node);
    if (isRed(node.left) && isRed(node.right)) flipColor(node);
    node.numberOfSubTree = size(node.left) + size(node.right) + 1;
    return node;
}
```
